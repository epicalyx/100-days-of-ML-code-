## Day 0 : September 25 , 2018


**Today's Progress** : I have commited myself to work on machine learning everyday and so I have searched on a few online resources to learn and take guidance from. I am still exploring the projects that I would want to work on .

**Thoughts** : I hope this accelerated learning process helps me develop machine learning skils in a very efficient way. 


## Day 1 : September 26 , 2018


**Today's Progress** : Started with Google ML Crash Course. Completed upto Reducing Loss today.

**Thoughts** : The course is well suited for beginners. The video lectures are short yet descriptive and make the concepts really easy to grasp.
