# 100 days of ML log

## Day 0 : September 25 , 2018


**Today's Progress** : I have commited myself to work on machine learning everyday and so I have searched on a few online resources to learn and take guidance from. I am still exploring the projects that I would want to work on .

**Thoughts** : I hope this accelerated learning process helps me develop machine learning skils in a very efficient way. 


## Day 1 : September 26 , 2018


**Today's Progress** : Started with Google ML Crash Course. Completed upto Reducing Loss today.

**Thoughts** : The course is well suited for beginners. The video lectures are short yet descriptive and make the concepts really easy to grasp.

## Day 2 : September 27 , 2018


**Today's Progress** : Learned about Gradient Descent Algorithm for Linear Regression Model from Coursera's ML course for conceptual understanding. For implementation purposes, took help from online resources and wrote basic code for simple linear regression.

**Thoughts** : It was fun learning from Coursera's ML course by Andrew Ng. He teaches ML concepts in a very unique way making them interesting for learner of any level.

## Day 3 : September 28 , 2018


**Today's Progress** : Completed upto Validation from Google ML Crash Course.

**Thoughts** : The concepts are really well explained in video lectures.

## Day 4 : September 29 , 2018


**Today's Progress** : Implemented a simple model for house price prediction using univariate linear regression using scikit-learn library.Will be adding more to this implementation code for proper prediction of prices. For understanding how to implement the code I went through Udemy's Machine Learning course. 

**Thoughts** : The contents of the lectures are good. All the steps for analysing the data are well explained.

## Day 5 : September 30 , 2018


**Today's Progress** : Learned about multivariate linear regression, feature scaling and polynomial regression from Cousera ML lectures.

**Thoughts** : The maths behind the algorithms is well explained in the course. Looking forward to implement these algorithms.
